A project that I was working on for a long time. Sadly, there is not too much content that can showcase the vast majority of mage mechanics.
But there are many. For now, there is a big number of many configurable towers. This readme will provide a brief overview of the game mechanics, be aware that the majority is not included in the game yet. 

Three armor types and shields for enemies. Shields block special effects like dot or slow.

Three types of damage. Shredding (pierce), usual and magic. Every tower in the game, including aura ones, can provide DPS with every single type. 

Usual towers can be split shot, AOE, moon glaive type, and can differ in attack speed and range. 

Special linear AOE tower, unique to this game only, can bounce off walls and spawns two waves that follow the enemy's path, to exclude the possibility of aoeing to another line.

Extreme amount of different auras. They can affect every single stat in the game or provide with DPS, slow or snare.

Ground traps that attack ground enemies (everyone except blue), but only two times per wave. 

Mine towers that spawn explosives every wave. 

Target priority. Towers that can shoot will follow seven intersecting rules of choosing. They can attack special enemy types (boss, medium, small, unique), target shielded enemy first, try to one-shot enemies, target closest to themselves or the end of a line, and hold target until it dies or leaves the range. 

DOT effects. They can slow, stack or not to stack, differ in damage types and every tower in the game can be configured to do additional dot DPS.

Enemies can have spells. Several testing ones right now can heal surrounding units or give them shields. Additionally, they can have auras. Auras can give them armor, speed them up, and align movement.

Players also have mana and can teleport enemies to the start, bury small ones, kill them with huge damage or spawn a chain of lightning. 

Players also have items in their disposition. Items can provide for stats and special effects (like a critical strike) or change almost any tower stat. Items can be used in recipes to combine them into new items with new fun effects. 

And many more...
